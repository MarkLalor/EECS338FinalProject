The use of functional imaging in neurodegenerative diseases has increased in recent years, with applications in research into the underlying pathophysiology, aiding in diagnosis, or evaluating new treatments. In Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), these imaging methods have expanded our understanding of the disease beyond dopaminergic deficits. Moreover, functional imaging methods have described alterations in functional networks relating not only to the motor symptoms, but also to many nonmotor features of PD, such as cognitive dysfunction. From a clinical viewpoint, functional imaging methods can assist in monitoring disease progression, such as in the context of clinical trials, and holds the potential to aid in early diagnosis of PD and differentiation from other parkinsonian disorders.
