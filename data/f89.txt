OBJECTIVE
To determine whether the G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 209 (G209A) mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene is responsible for familial Parkinson disease (PD) in the US population.


DESIGN
Polymerase chain reaction-based DNA analysis of consecutive patients with PD and family history of PD.


SETTING
A university-affiliated movement disorder clinic and a Veterans Affairs clinical research laboratory.


PATIENTS
Forty-four patients with PD and family history of PD and 29 patients with sporadic PD, all with no known Greek and/or Italian background.


RESULTS
None of the DNA samples showed the G209A mutation.


CONCLUSION
The G209A mutation is rare in US patients with familial PD.
