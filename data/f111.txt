Advances in imaging have made it possible to detect functional and, increasingly, structural changes in Parkinson's disease. Although imaging is not yet routinely used for diagnosis, such an application is becoming increasingly feasible. Of potentially greater interest, however, is the use of imaging as a biomarker to detect premotor disease and disease progression. Imaging also provides insights into complications of Parkinson's disease and its long-term treatment, and the role of dopamine in the normal brain. Furthermore, these techniques can be applied to animal models, to help validate these models and allow their use in the study of potential disease-modifying therapies.
