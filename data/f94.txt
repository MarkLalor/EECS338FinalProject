Extranigral neuropathological changes may precede the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones in Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, non-motor disturbances are an interesting target for the development of tests aimed at identifying individuals with premotor PD. An impaired sense of smell occurs with high prevalence in the clinical motor stages of PD patients and has also been reported in first-degree relatives of PD patients. In a prospective study in 361 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of PD patients, we studied the value of a two-step approach, combining olfactory testing and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging, in detecting patients in the premotor phase of PD. Unexplained hyposmia alone was associated with a 12.5% risk of developing PD within a five year period. Cox regression analysis revealed that odour discrimination performance was most strongly correlated with the risk of future PD. Furthermore, all relatives that later developed PD had both hyposmia and abnormally reduced striatal DAT binding at baseline. The results of our studies provide the proof-of-principle that a two-step approach of olfactory testing and DAT SPECT imaging may serve to diagnose PD in its premotor phase. Yet, the low positive predictive value of hyposmia indicates that a wider application of this approach for screening purposes would require too many DAT SPECT scans in healthy individuals. Therefore, future studies in larger populations are necessary to further characterize premotor PD and identify additional genetic and/or clinical susceptibility markers to be used in conjunction with olfactory testing as additional screening steps toward diagnosing PD in its earliest stages.
