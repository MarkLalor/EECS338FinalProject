Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mutations in genes a-Synuclein (SNCA), Parkin (PARK2), Leucinerich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), PTENinduced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARK 7 (DJ-1) have been firmly established to cause mendelian forms of PD. SNCA, the first known gene to cause PD, is a cytosolic neuronal protein. The protein a-Synuclein which is expressed throughout the mammalian brain is thought to be involved in neurotransmitter release and vesicle turnover at presynaptic terminals. Mutations in SNCA cause rapidly progressing autosomal dominant PD with a tendency to form Lewy bodies. To date, three missense mutations (A53TG209A, A30PC88G and E46KG188A), gene duplications and triplications of SNCA have been reported. Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 have been implicated in patients with autosomal dominant and also in sporadic PD. The most common LRRK2 pathogenic mutation G2019S affects the MAPK domain and increases the kinase activity of the protein [1]. Only a few mutational studies in Indian PD patients have been published. Considering the diversity of Indian population, we concentrated on PD patients in the Tamil Nadu state (South India) who have not been studied before. We investigated mutations in the autosomal dominant genes SNCA (A53T, A30P, E46K) and LRRK2 (G2019S) in 140 South Indian PD patients.
