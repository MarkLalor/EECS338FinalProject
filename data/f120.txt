This review summarizes major advances in biomarker discovery for diagnosis, differential diagnosis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), with emphasis on neuroimaging and biochemical markers. Potential strategies to develop biomarkers capable of predicting PD in the prodromal stage before the appearance of motor symptoms or correlating with nonmotor symptoms, an active area of research, are also discussed.
