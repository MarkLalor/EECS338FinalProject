The differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes is considered one of the most challenging in neurology and error rates in the clinical diagnosis can be high even at specialized centres. Despite several limitations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has undoubtedly enhanced the diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism over the last three decades. This review aims to summarize research findings regarding the value of the different MRI techniques, including advanced sequences at high- and ultra-high-field MRI and modern image analysis algorithms, in the diagnostic work-up of Parkinson’s disease. This includes not only the exclusion of alternative diagnoses for Parkinson’s disease such as symptomatic parkinsonism and atypical parkinsonism, but also the diagnosis of early, new onset, and even prodromal Parkinson’s disease.
