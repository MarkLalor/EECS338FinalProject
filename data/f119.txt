Cortico-striatal-thalamic network functional connectivity (FC) and its relationship with levodopa (L-dopa) were investigated in 69 patients with hemiparkinsonism (25 drug-na√Øve [n-PD] and 44 under stable/optimized dopaminergic treatment [t-PD]) and 27 controls. Relative to controls, n-PD patients showed an increased FC between the left and the right basal ganglia, and a decreased connectivity of the affected caudate nucleus and thalamus with the ipsilateral frontal and insular cortices. Compared with both controls and n-PD patients, t-PD patients showed a decreased FC among the striatal and thalamic regions, and an increased FC between the striatum and temporal cortex, and between the thalamus and several sensorimotor, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. In both n-PD and t-PD, patients with more severe motor disability had an increased striatal and/or thalamic FC with temporal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions. Cortico-striatal-thalamic functional abnormalities occur in patients with hemiparkinsonism, antecede the onset of the motor symptoms on the opposite body side and are modulated by L-dopa. In patients with hemiparkinsonism, L-dopa is likely to facilitate a compensation of functional abnormalities possibly through an increased thalamic FC.
