A G209A mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene was recently discovered in a large Italian kindred and three unrelated Greek kindreds with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequently, another mutation in the gene (G88C) was also identified in a German family with autosomal PD. These results indicate that the alpha-synuclein gene may have an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. This study was designed to screen the existence of both mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene among 100 Chinese patients with PD, including 80 with sporadic and 20 with familial PD. Results showed that none of our patients, both sporadic and familial PD, had either of the two mutations of this gene. We therefore conclude that although of great interest, these two mutations are not relevant for the pathogenesis of PD in a Han Chinese population.
