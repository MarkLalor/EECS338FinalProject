Akinetic crises are one of the problems arising in patients with Parkinson's disease in particular after long term treatment with levo-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). They are characterized by severe disability to move. Increasing dosages of L-DOPA and decarboxylase or monoaminooxidase inhibitors do not improve these symptoms. Intravenously applied iron in the form of a ferri-ferro-complex exhibits a considerable benefit for all patients treated so far. They regained a remarkable mobility. Their disability score dropped from up to 90 percent down to 30 percent. The effect is dosage-dependent, and withdrawal of iron will lead again to akinetic crises.
