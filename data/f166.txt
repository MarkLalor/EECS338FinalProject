High angular resolution measurements of diffusion are used to estimate the angular distribution and diffusion anisotropy of fibers in a voxel. A simple, axially symmetric model of diffusion in white matter fibers is used to relate diffusion measurements to fiber properties. The new technique is called fiber orientation estimated using continuous axially symmetric tensors (FORECAST). It is tested using both numerical simulation and in vivo measurements. The new method agrees with other methods in voxels containing single fibers, but resolves crossing fibers better, at least at the level of diffusion weighting used in this study (tr(b) = 1480 s/mm2). The simplifying assumptions of the model are tested by comparison with the "model-free" q-ball analysis of in vivo data and the results are shown to be in good agreement. The new method addresses the problem of partial volume averaging in diffusion tensor imaging and provides a basis for more reliable estimates of fiber orientation and fractional anisotropy.
